Her fellow commissioners voted to have Stacy chair the Planning Commission for 3 years, ultimately culminating in over 5 years of service and moving the town into the future ensuring that our growth is beautiful and well planned.',
            'With a Business Administration Degree from Cal Berkeley, Stacy has analyzed balance sheets and business plans and knows the ins and outs of how a City finances all of its many projects.',
